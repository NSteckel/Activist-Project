        We interviewed Suzuyo Takazato, Hiromi Minamoto, and Kozue Akibayashi about their experiences
        in organizing against U.S. militarism in Okinawa. For approximately 40 years, Hiromi Minamato
        worked at Radio Okinawa as a radio producer, creating programs centered on women leaders, 
        human rights, and environmental issues in Okinawa. Hiromi met Suzuyo in 1985 when she 
        interviewed Suzuyo for her radio show, and the two have been working together since then on
        issues related to gender and peace in Okinawa. Together, they formed Okinawa Women Act 
        Against Military Violence (OWAAMV) in 1995 after the rape of a 12 year old Okinawan girl by
        U.S. servicemen. Kozue met Suzuyo, Hiromi, and others in OWAAMV in 1996 in New York while 
        doing graduate work on feminist peace education. Through their work they&#39;ve connected with
        other women and organizations across the globe that are fighting against U.S. militarism.

        Today, 70.6% of US military bases in Japan are located on the small island of Okinawa, which 
        comprises just 0.6% of Japanese land mass. In this way, US military presence in Okinawa cannot
        be denied, and this presence has led to countless acts of violence against the Okinawan 
        population. So as to remember those who have been sacrificed, OWAAMV has been creating a 
        chronology of violence and rape against Okinawan women at the hands of US military personnel 
        since their arrival 76 years ago. Recently, OWAAMV has been organizing protests against the 
        construction of the new military base in Henoko Bay, which is home to coral reefs and rare 
        marine populations. Beyond this, OWAAMV works to call attention to issues related to US military
        violence in Okinawa, as well as to organize women&#39;s gatherings.

        Ultimately, the women behind OWAAMV would like to see Okinawa overcome colonial control, 
        in order to create a society in which everyone can live safely and confidently. Hiromi wishes 
        to eliminate poverty and violence against women and children, problems which she argues are 
        underlied by war and militarism. Suzuyo hopes that those who see this project are better informed
        about the history of Okinawa so that they may understand why the situation in Okinawa is where
        it is today. They hope that by sharing their own experiences and knowledge, future generations may
        continue the work they have been doing, so that one day Okinawa can be free again. The song heard 
        in the video is a protest song the women and other protesters sing when they sit at the gates of 
        the Henoko construction site.

    <h3 id="Historical_Background">Historical Background</h3>
    <p>US military presence in Okinawa can be traced back to World War II, when the US army used
       Okinawa for island-hopping to mainland Japan. After the war, the US Navy took control of 
       Okinawa. In 1951, Japan signed the Treaty of San Francisco along with the 48 victorious 
       countries in World War II, extending the jurisdiction of the US over Okinawa for 20 years.
       Even after 1969, when the island was returned to Japanese sovereignty, the US remained a 
       significant military presence on Okinawa. As of 2013, the US military still takes up over 
       18% of the land area of Okinawa. In recent years, in response to Okinawans&#39; resistance, 
       there have been plans for relocation of some of the military bases to other locations in 
       Japan, yet many military bases still remain and some, like the Henoko base, are in the 
       process of construction.

      It has been 25 years since the pivotal US military sexual violence case in Okinawa Prefecture 
      in 1995, during which 3 US troops stationed in Okinawa abducted and raped a 12-year-old 
      Okinawan girl. In response, more than 80,000 people gathered to protest, demanding that 
      the US and Japanese governments amend the agreement and reduce the size of the US military
      base, making it the most representative protest in Okinawa after World War II. Since then,
      civil organizations have also begun to attempt to create a chronology and record of assaults
      as well as contact the victims of sexual assault by the US military in Okinawa (Johnston).

      <div class = "timeIntro">
        Below is a timeline that outlines the chronology of several important events that 
        were discussed in our interviews. Much of the information is from Kozue Akibayashi&#39s

        Dignity&#34 linked below. While this is not an exhaustive list of all important moments 
        in these women&#39s organizing against US militarism in Okinawa, it provides context for 
        some of the events that they often spoke about in our interviews.
