    <p>And now here is my secret, a very simple secret:
      It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.

      <p>Margo Okazawa-Rey is an educator, writer, and activist. Her demilitarization work in South 
        Korea speaks volumes on such important and complex issues as women's rights, American 
        imperialism, racism, and other hegemonic transnational systems. This interactive map highlights 
        parts of this work that aren't easily elevated within academic structures. As our opening quote 
        describes, these "invisible" details are actually some of the most important and fruitful parts 
        of the story.
