        and Taiwan in the west. Its southwestern border comprises the Philippine islands of Luzon, <br>
        Catanduanes, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao. Its northern border comprises the Japanese islands <br>
        of Honshu, Shikoku and Kyūshū. Its eastern border is the secondisland chain to the west, <br>
        comprising the Bonin Islands and Iwo Jima in the northeast, the Mariana Islands (including <br>
        Guam, Saipan and Tinian) in the due east, and Halmahera, Palau, Yap and Ulithi (of the <br>
