        <p>This website was made as a project for Occidental College's media course &#8220;Media Activism Through Participatory Video.&#8221; <br>
        Four groups of students each researched a different area, and their findings were then collected into this project. Professor<br> 
        Vivian Lin oversaw the students throughout their research. The project was made in partnership with the International Women&#39;s <br>
        Network Against Militarization, Voices of Women Media and The University of Hong Kong.</p>
