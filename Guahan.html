    <div class="intro">
      <p>Welcome to the Gu&aring;han homepage for the Occidental College MAC 250 students, HKU partners, and IWNAM 
        participatory media project, completed in the Spring of 2021. Over the course of the Spring semester, 
        the MAC 250 students Emma, Sarah, Julie, Maddie, and HKU Partner Bonnie were able to collaborate with 
        the International Women&#39;s Network Against Militarism (IWNAM) and engaged activist Lisa Linda Natividad in a 
        series of interviews to dive deeper into the current standing of Gu&aring;han&#39;s (Guam) demilitarization and
        decolonization endeavors.
      </p>
      <p>
        As previously stated, we had an array of goals for this project, which included: Strengthening our 
        common consciousness and voice by sharing experiences, Creating accessible and legible knowledge for 
        a vast audience on the topic of CHamoru and Gu&aring;han sovereignty, and continuing the work of transpacific
        coalition-building started and propelled by organizations of activists such as the IWNAM.

      <p>Lisa Linda Natividad, a daughter of the Se&#39;mon and Senen clans from Mangilao, Gu&aring;han. She is a Professor 
        of Social Work at the University of Guam, the primary convener of the Gu&aring;han Coalition for Peace and Justice,
        and a founding member of I Hagan Famalao&#39;an Gu&aring;han. She is an indigenous CHamoru who has championed the 
        exposure of the human rights violations against her people and homeland Gu&aring;han, which is a military colony 
        of the United States.  She has spoken globally on the topics of demilitarization, decolonization, and the 
        critical role women play in the creation of safe and thriving communities. Dr. Natividad has presented 
        interventions on the halting of the massive military build-up on Gu&aring;han before the United Nations Fourth 
        Committee, Decolonization Committee, and the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. She is the grand-daughter
        Bernadita and Jose Quichocho Salas and the daughter of Concepcion and Paul Natividad. She is also the mother 
        of Atdao-mami Natividad and lives in the village of Inalahan, Gu&aring;han.</p>

      <p>
        We are honored to have spoken with Lisa Linda Natividad tackling the topics related to how militaristic 
        influence create barriers to trans-pacific solidarity, discussing the recent methods of decolonization 
        which CHamoru people are undertaking for indigenous solidarity, and how to create a holistic understanding 
        of what a de-colonized imagined future looks like for the CHamoru people and Gu&aring;han.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Before beginning, note that we use &quot;CHamoru,&quot; throughout our project, reflecting Lisa&#39;s research which 
        states: &quot;CHamoru is the phonetically correct, indigenous spelling of the word referring to the indigenous 
        people of the Mariana Islands and their spoken language;&quot; as well as our use of Gu&aring;han as, &quot;it is the 
        indigenous name for the island of Guam, meaning &quot;we have&quot; in the indigenous language.&quot; 
      </p>
      <p>
        The focus of our initial interview with Lisa Natividad was to round out the concept of love in connection 
        with demilitarization work, decolonizing land and people, and discovering a route to liberation. Even more 
        importantly, Lisa made clear the division between fear and love, and how that leads to increased 
        militarization in a region like Gu&aring;han, which has been colonized since 1668 and has resulted in a complex 
        and destructive system of dependency. Lisa calls it the &quot;dependency of the mind,&quot; and talked to us at length 
        about the way that colonization permeates land, communities, and settles deep inside the psyche of the 
        colonized. As Lisa reinforced throughout our interview with a myriad of personal and political experiences, 
        The U.S. does not have a relationship of love with Gu&aring;han or any of its colonized military base locations. 
        Lisa spoke: &quot;As a colonized people, it&#39;s not glamorous&#8230; you look at all the social indicators from poverty 
        to homelessness to drug and alcohol addiction, abuse, domestic violence. We top the charts in all of those 
        issues.&quot;

        With such a breadth of issues to cover and stories to tell, we hope the content you find here is a small 
        drop in the ocean of knowledge we all continue seeking in our fight to demilitarize the nation of Gu&aring;han, 
        and all other Pacific Island communities currently colonized by the United States, and as a result, 
        exceptionally over-militarized at the fate of Native populations and sacred homelands.
